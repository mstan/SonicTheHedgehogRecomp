/*
 * ym2612.c — cycle-stamped YM2612 wrapper over clownmdemu's FM library.
 *
 * This branch reuses clownmdemu's FM state machine (fm.c, known correct for
 * SMPS audio — the oracle build's sound is already validated against it)
 * as a pure library. We drive it with the cycle-stamped events queued by
 * 68K bus writes, calling FM_Update between writes so envelope/LFO state
 * advances continuously across the ~20k-cycle VBla music-handler span.
 *
 * A follow-up commit can lift fm.c into runner/audio/ for production
 * builds that drop clownmdemu entirely; the API here (ym2612_advance /
 * write / render) is designed to stay stable across that transition.

 *
 * For the mixer: we hold samples generated during ym2612_advance in this
