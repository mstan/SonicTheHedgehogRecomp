/*
 * reverse_debug.h — Tier-1 reverse-debugger: ring buffer + bus tap.
 *
 * Design (simpler than the snesrecomp equivalent because 68K has a bus):
 *   - Generator emits `g_rdb_current_func = 0xXXXXXXu;` at the top of
 *     every func_XXXXXX body when --reverse-debug is on.
 *   - reverse_debug.c installs itself as g_mem_write_trace_fn (the
 *     shared bus-write callback that clownmdemu-core fires on every
 *     M68kWriteCallback).
 *   - Every bus write is recorded with (frame, adr, val, width, func,
 *     caller_return_addr), filtered by up to 8 configurable ranges.
 *
 * This works in BOTH the native build (recompiled C drives the bus) and
 * the oracle build (clown68000 interpreter drives the bus). In the
 * oracle build g_rdb_current_func stays 0 because no recompiled function
 * bodies run; the caller column (ret0 from A7) still gives useful
 * attribution against SMWDisX-equivalent disassembly.
 *
 * When SONIC_REVERSE_DEBUG is not defined, this header is empty and
 * nothing is linked in.

 * Tier 2: block-level stepper (native only).
 *
 * Generator emits `rdb_on_block(0x72A5Cu);` after each label_%06X:; and

 * branch when no break is armed — cost-dominated by the load. Only the
 * slow path (rdb_on_block_slow) decides whether to park the game fiber.
 *
 * When the game fiber parks, it yields via glue_yield_for_break(); the
 * main loop drains cmd_server until a resume command clears the pending
 * flag, then SwitchToFiber(s_game_fiber) re-enters rdb_on_block_slow
 * and execution continues.
 *

 * bodies). All Tier 2 TCP commands reply with "native only".
